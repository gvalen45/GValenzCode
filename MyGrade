Jose Gabriel Valenzuela, Feb. 14th 2019 - MyGrade

This program determines the letter grade for CSC110AB(online).
The user is asked to input scores on programming assignmets, MPL 
Homework and a Final Exam. The grade is then determined using
if and else statements that calculate their letter grade based on
the three user inputs.
